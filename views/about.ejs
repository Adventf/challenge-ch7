        Rock paper scissors is a hand game, usually played between two people,
        in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an
        outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a
        flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle
        finger extended, forming a V).
